# OpenClaw

Run [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) on Apify infrastructure.

## 🔥 What is OpenClaw?

Clears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights. All from Apify platform.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This Actor [metamorphs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/metamorph) into the [AI Sandbox](https://apify.com/apify/ai-sandbox) and automatically launches OpenClaw TUI in the terminal.

On startup, it:
1. Installs OpenClaw globally via npm
2. Configures OpenClaw to use Apify OpenRouter proxy with Kimi K2.5 model
3. Runs non-interactive onboarding
4. Starts the OpenClaw gateway on port 18789
5. Opens OpenClaw TUI in the browser terminal

## 🚀 Quick Start

2. OpenClaw TUI opens in the console terminal
